Hello! Welcome to the Gig Scheduler Help Menu! 

The Gig Scheduler program allows you to do one of four options. 

Option 1: Adding a new gig. The program will prompt 
you for input that will be used to create a new gig.
Please enter the number '1' if you want to select
this option.

Option 2: Adding a new band. This option will prompt
you for input to either create a new band and/or
will check to see if the band you want at your gig
has already been added. If not, it will create a new band 
and add it. If there is a band with the unique name
that exists, then it will create the band and add it 
to the database. Please enter the number '2' if 
you want to select this option. 

Option 3: Viewing the entire schedule. You are able 
to enter a start date and/or an end date, but are 
not required to enter either. The program will then display
what gigs are occurring between the two dates. Follow the 
format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. Please enter the number '3' if 
you want to select this option. 

Option 4: Viewing the help menu. Seems like you 
know how to do that because you're here. The 
help menu displays how to work the program.
Enter the number '4' to get here. 

Option 5: Quitting the application. If you're 
done using gig scheduler, enter the number '5'.

Hope this helps!
